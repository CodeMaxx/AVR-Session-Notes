# AVR Session - Electronics Club IIT-B

This repository contains presentations used in the 2105 AVR session held by the Electronics Club of IIT Bombay. It also contains the notes I made during the session which would be helpful in understanding the material.

The notes might be a little hard to understand, so feel free to contact me for explanations.

Cheers,
